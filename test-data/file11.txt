           DISCLAIMER: THIS ARTICLE USES A FEW WORDS THAT MAY BE INAPPROPRIATE FOR YOUNG CHILDREN TO READ.

Shalom Brothers and Sisters

All Praises are given to Yah the Most High Through his son Yahoshua who has been given to us as Messiah, redeemer and a Savior.

I would like to touch on something briefly in this article.  I want to discuss what are curse words and what profanity is.  As we strengthen our walk with Yah, we understand that we must shed all the remnants of Babylon.  Before we come into the fullness of our walk with the father, Babylon must be given back her Food, Thoughts, Clothes, Ways and more importantly her speech.   Within the language of Babylon (English) she has a group of words that she has sat aside, these words are considered to be at the bottom of the language.  Of course we are speaking about the so called Curse words.  It's important that I list these words, I don't intend to offend anyone, but we need to have an understanding of what is what.

The primary curse words used in the ENGLISH LANGUAGE are as follows
Mother Fucker
Fucker
Fuck
Shit
From the definition of a Curse word, we need to understand if these are indeed words to bring about a Curse.

According to the Oxford Illustrated Dictionary on Page 205 found under CURSE   it says:

CURSE - A SOLEMN UTTERANCE INTENDED TO INVOKE A SUPER NATURAL POWER TO INFLICT DESTRUCTION OR PUNISHMENT ON A PERSON OR THING   2. THE EVIL SUPPOSEDLY RESULTING FROM A CURSE.

Those two definitions are exactly what a curse is, and we can prove this.  When Yah pronounce the curses upon his people Israel, not one of the so-called curse words of Babylon was used, lets see.

Deuteronomy 28:16 Cursed shalt thou be in the city, and cursed shalt thou be in the field.

17 Cursed shall be thy basket and thy store.

18 Cursed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy land, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep.

19 Cursed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and cursed shalt thou be when thou goest out.

20 YAH shall send upon thee cursing, vexation, and rebuke, in all that thou settest thine hand unto for to do, until thou be destroyed, and until thou perish quickly; because of the wickedness of thy doings, whereby thou hast forsaken me.

By Yah saying  Israel would be cursed,  he isn't saying Israel would go around speaking the profanity of Babylon?  When Yah spoke the curses against Israel he  pronounced a power to inflict destruction or punishment on a people. That's what a curse is,  words uttered to bring about evil on a person or thing.  True curse words are.

I hope you die
I wish they kill you
I hate your guts
why don't you disappear
I hope no good thing ever come to you

These are curses, many of you may have UNKNOWING thrown curses at people and had them thrown back at you.  Many of our children throw curses at each other everyday, because they haven't been taught what a cures word is, we nor them pay it no mind.  Curses are real, and we Israelites are living proof of that, every curse Yah pronounced upon us, has come true.  Everything from captivity, to coming into slavery in ships, has happen to the Israelite nation.

Lets briefly look at a very famous curse of our modern times.  This is the curse of the Chicago Cubs baseball team.  Read the following information below from the website reverse the curse.

Notice when this guy put the curse on the Chicago cubs, he just spoke it into being, he didn't go out and do some ritual, he spoke a curse against the Cubs. He said "the Cubs ain't gonna win no more", and from that day to this one, the Chicago cubs have been noting but losers. They have not made it back the championship since 1945 the year the curse was put on them.  They have come close but never made it, and the only reason they can't win is because they are Cursed.  Another point to notice is the Guy who put the curse on the cubs never used one of the so called curse words of Babylon.

Now since we know the curse words spoken in the language of BABYLON are not Curse words  at all, then what are they?

They are profanity, words of profane.

 Profane is the root word of Profanity.  Profanity means a Profane act, profane language and blasphemy. Profane means Vulgar& obscene.  These words are consider to be the most filthy words in the English language.  If the Gentiles say these words are profane, and Garbage, then we should take note.  We know the things they consider good, is actually bad, so we know if they say something of theirs is bad IT IS BAD. FOR THAT REASON WE SHOULDN'T SPEAK ANY PROFANITY, THE OTHER REASON IS, WE ARE TOLD NOT TO SPEAK ANY PROFANE WORDS

1st Timothy  6:20 O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called:

2Ti 2:16 But shun profane (PROFANITY) and vain babblings: for they will increase unto more WICKEDNESS.

Be Careful of that negative energy you throw out, it will come back.  Pronouncing Curses and using profanity is negative energy.  Words come from with in, if you speak profane things, they are coming from your heart.  You must remove all profanity and negative energy from your temple, that's the only way Yah will dwell with in.  Yah is not profane, he doesn't deal with profanity or profane things, nor does he dwell in profanity.  Profanity is of the Devil, those who are of Yah speak the words of Yah.  

John 3:34 “For He whom Yah has sent speaks the Words of YAH, for YAH does not give the Spirit by measure.

Never forget You will be held accountable for every idle word you speak.
Mat 12:36 “And I say to you that for every idle word men speak, they shall give an account of it in the day of judgment.

I pray this article in some way can help you in your walk with Yah, help you to get closer to the Father

Shalom
